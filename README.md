# Data Analysis of Symptoms and Diagnoses

## Description
This project focuses on analyzing the relationships between various symptoms and diagnoses using a provided dataset. The analysis involves correlation studies, group analysis, contingency tables, and chi-square tests to identify significant associations and patterns within the data.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-analysis-project.git
    cd data-analysis-project
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Place your data file (`symptoms_diagnoses.csv`) in the `data/` directory.

2. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook notebooks/Analysis.ipynb
    ```

3. The notebook will guide you through the data analysis steps, including data loading, cleaning, and visualization.

## Data
The dataset used in this project should be in CSV format with the following structure:
- Columns: Symptoms (e.g., `sudden_fever`, `headache`, `vomiting`, etc.) and a `diagnosis` column indicating the medical condition.

## Analysis
The analysis involves several steps:
- **Correlation Analysis**: Understanding how symptoms correlate with each other.
- **Group Analysis**: Grouping data by diagnosis to study the distribution of symptoms.
- **Contingency Tables**: Creating tables to show the frequency of symptoms for each diagnosis.
- **Chi-Square Test**: Performing statistical tests to identify significant associations between symptoms and diagnoses.

## Visualizations
The project includes various data visualization techniques to illustrate the relationships between symptoms and diagnoses:
- Heatmaps
- Bar plots
- Box plots
- Scatter plots

## Results
The key findings from the analysis include:
- Identification of strong correlations between specific symptoms.
- Insights into the symptom patterns for different diagnoses.
- Significant associations revealed through chi-square tests.
