**Title:** Vector-Borne Disease Analysis and Visualization

**Description:**

This repository provides a framework for exploring and visualizing data related to vector-borne diseases. It helps to identify patterns and relationships between symptoms, and disease outbreaks.

**Key Features:**

* **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Tools and scripts to handle missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies. 
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Implementations of various techniques to analyze data distributions, correlations, and trends.
* **Data Visualization:** Interactive visualizations (e.g., Linegraphs, Barplot, heatmaps, scatter plots) to effectively communicate insights.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/your-username/vector-borne-disease-analysis.git`
2. **Install dependencies:** Refer to `requirements.txt` (if used) and install necessary libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. **Prepare your data:** Ensure your data is formatted correctly (e.g., CSV) and organized in the designated directory.
4. **Run the scripts:** Execute the provided scripts (`eda.py`, `visualization.py`, etc.) or modify them for your specific needs.
